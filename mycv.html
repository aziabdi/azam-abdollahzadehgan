           <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            I love the attention to details, going further than everyone thinks it's possible or sufficient, extracting creativity from data and evidence, good questions and solving a problem creatively.

            All my career in entrepreneurship, business development and marketing are based on creativity and attention to detail. I've never stopped at what is expected, I believe people who can learn to achieve better results, not just for the sake of it, will succeed in any circumstances whether odds are on their side or not.
